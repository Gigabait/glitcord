# litcord - 0.0.5a

Welcome to litcord's repository. This is an early version and thus is not functional nor meant for distribution yet. Anything you see may be subject to change.

Works with [Luvit](https://github.com/luvit/luvit), which, roughly speaking, is *a node.js style API* for Lua.

Please, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/satom99/litcord/wiki) for *more documentation on how you can use and obtain the library*.
