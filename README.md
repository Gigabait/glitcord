# litcord - 0.0.8

Welcome to litcord's repository, a Lua wrapper for Discord's official API. Being asynchronous and mainly object-oriented makes it really easy to use. Join other litcord developers on the [Discord API server](https://discord.gg/0SBTUU1wZTYEf3Hy)!

Works with [Luvit](https://github.com/luvit/luvit), which, roughly speaking, is *a node.js style API* for Lua.

Please, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/satom99/litcord/wiki) for more documentation on how you can use and obtain the library.
